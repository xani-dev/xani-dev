# Real Time Bus Tracker ðŸšŒ
Mi first map creation and manipulation project. 

This project uses Mapbox API, CSS, HTML and Javascript. 

## Description: 
This project provides a visual real-time tracking display of the [Bus Route #1 of Boston](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/1/line), running between Harvard and Nubian. 
Displays a colored set of icons showing all the buses running that route at a specific moment in time.
Info can also be updated by pressing a button, located on the top right corner, if needed.

## How to Run: 
In order to run this project, you must update the Mapbox Access Token with your own on the script.js file.\
``` mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR-API-CODE-HERE'; ```

## Future improvements: 

- [ ]Will add a bus icon, instead the Default MapBox Marker
- [ ]Add a popup per marker indicating bus direction and seat availability.
